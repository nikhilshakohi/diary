React Notes:


In index.js:
.render(<App/>, document.getElementById("root"));


In App.js, everything in return is javaScript, React converts it into HTML

Inside curly braces {}, we write functions

To pass argument inside function in onClick (inside div in return function), {() => function(arg)}

********Firebase******

*Added assist app in firebase website,
*In terminal, 
	npm install firebase
	npm install -g firebase-tools

After that, in cmd,
	firebase login (After redirected to chrome, Logged in via google account)
	firebase init (gave permissions to github and others (npm ci && npm run build command to run before deploy -is added))
	firebase deploy

*************Database***********

In Firestore (Web), changed the rules from
	allow read, write: if false;
to
	allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
Only then I was able to add the data to the collection.



*************GitHub************

In github, open a new repository.. (dont check any options)
Then follow steps shown..
In terminal,
	git init //will add a new repository
	git add . //will add a blank file to cache
	git commit -m "first commit" //Will commit the changes in the cache
	git branch -M main //will select the branch
	git remote add origin https://github.com/nikhilshakohi/assist.git //will select the repo
