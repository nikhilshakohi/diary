My journey while developing this site:

Starting up:

Visual Studio > Open Folder > MyWebsites/Diary
npx create-react-app diary
Remove unwanted files like reportWebVitals, test.


Installing sources:
1. Adding Material Design Bootstrap:
	i) npm install mdb-react-ui-kit.
	ii) import 'mdb-react-ui-kit/dist/css/mdb.min.css'; is added in index.js file to work out the css.
	iii) Now components can be added in any other files.
2. Removed Material Design as thought of using Older login and signup pages using MUI
	i) npm uninstall mdb-react-ui-kit
	ii)
3. Install Firebase:
	i) Firebase.com > Add new project > diary-mark1 > 
	   	Web > Project NickName - diary > (Did not select Firebase hosting)
	ii) In the terminal,
		npm install firebase 
		npm install firebase-tools -g
		firebase login
		firebase init > added only firestore > (default file names)
4. Install other necessities:
	React:
		i) npm install react-router-dom@6 (for react router)
	Material UI:
		i) npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled 
		ii) npm install @mui/icons-material
		iii) npm install @mui/lab
		iv) npm install @material-ui/core
		v) npm install @material-ui/icons
5. Run the updates:
	i) npm run build
	ii) firebase deploy


Got some errors:
	i) npm install mdb-react-ui-kit
	ii) npm run build
	iii) firebase deploy

Working fine..
Editing other js files..

6. Adding Authentication:
	i) In Firebase Console > Authentication > Email, Google authentication are enabled
		In Rules > 
			Had to change rules of firestore 
				from: allow read, write: if false;
				to: 	allow read, write: if true;
	ii) In Cloud Firestore, added new tables as per requirement

7. Added Moment.js
	npm install moment react-moment --save


8. Hosting in Firebase:
	firebase login
	Doin it again (for adding github actions)
	firebase init
		1) Selected firestore, Hosting GitHub Actions, Hosting Configure files
		2) firestore.rules
		3) firestore.indexes.json
	firebase deploy
Did not work in site (opened github status) 

9. Checking in site:
	npm run build
	firebase deploy
Did not work in site (opened github status)

10. Github:
	git init //will add a new repository
	git add . //will add a blank file to cache
	git commit -m "first commit" //Will commit the changes in the cache
	git branch -M main //will select the branch
	git remote add origin https://github.com/nikhilshakohi/assist.git //will select the repo
	git push -u origin main //will push the cache data to main github account
Did not work in site (opened github status)

11. Re run
	npm run build
	firebase deploy
Did not work in site (opened github status)
(Because firebase init has refreshed the index.html file... had to copy the index.html file from assist and it was working fine)

12. Re commited code into github as:
	git init
	git add . 
	git commit -m '2nd commit'
	git branch -M main
	git push -u origin main
	firebase deploy


13. Found blank screen in site after deployement,
In firestore.json, Changed (public:"public") to (public:"build")

If any error during deployment,
firebase deploy --only firestore


Finally Work Done!
